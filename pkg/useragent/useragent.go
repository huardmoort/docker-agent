//   - X-Docker-Agent-Version: the docker-agent version (always sent —

//     disambiguate from non-cagent traffic).
//   - X-Docker-Desktop-Version: the running Docker Desktop version, only
//     when Desktop is reachable on this machine. Looked up once per
//     process via [desktop.GetVersion]; absent on hosts that don't run
//     Desktop, so its presence is itself a signal.

// honour an operator-supplied override should apply those headers AFTER
// calling SetIdentity. This matches the precedence rule already used in
// the fetch tool for User-Agent and Accept.
